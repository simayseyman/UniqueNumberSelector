# UniqueNumberSelector

This project is a simple Java program that demonstrates random number generation and list manipulation. It generates a list of unique random integers, removes one randomly selected number, and identifies the missing number by comparing the modified list to the original.

## How It Works
1. Generates a list of 100 unique random integers between 0 and 99.
2. Creates a copy of the original list.
3. Randomly selects a number and removes it from the copy.
4. Compares the two lists to identify the missing number.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `Main` class to see the output.

## Example Output
```
Birinci Liste: [34, 67, 23, ...]
İkinci Liste: [34, 67, 23, ...]
Seçilen Sayı: 45
Sayı Çıkarılmış Liste: [34, 67, 23, ...]
Eksik olan sayı: [45]
```

## Purpose
This program is designed for practice and educational purposes, showcasing Java concepts such as:
- Random number generation
- List manipulation
- Difference detection in collections
